	<p><center><big><big><big>The Galapagos sea lion is an endangered animal. It mainly lives in the Range in the Holland Islands, however, representatives of the species have also been recorded on Isla de la Plata and Gorgon off the coast of South America.</big></big></big></center></p>
	<p><center><big><big><big>Galapagos sea lions are quite large creatures. At birth, they weigh <iframe frameborder="0" width="15" height="15" src="symbols/примерно.html"></iframe> 25 kg, and adults <iframe frameborder="0" width="15" height="15" src="symbols/примерно.html"></iframe> 250 kg.</big></big></big></center></p>
	<p><center><big><big><big>In recent centuries, scientists have noticed that these sea lions have begun to die out. So why is this happening? This is because environmental factors are deteriorating, as well as due to mass infection from wild dogs. The first of the problems can be solved with a vaccine, and the second by reducing the amount of garbage in the seas and on land. To increase the population, you need to fix the above problems, but no one has done this yet.</big></big></big></center></p>
