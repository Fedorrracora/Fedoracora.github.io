		Far far away from here lived a little boy. Once a time he fall ill and stay at home on winter. He opened window, collected snow from the windowsill and made a snowball with button eyes, nose and mouth. The boy left the snowball outside because in the room it was warm and snowball would melt.

		The snowball laid on the windowsill, laid ... and decided to see the world. He jumped down and flew. But he was on the 16th floor, so he didn't see the world for long.

		An angry and grouchy neighbor lived in the same house. He swore at everyone, kicked the kids out of the elevator, and rode alone. Somehow an evil neighbor came out of the house and got a snowball on his head.

		That's how coincidences happen! Then the boy recovered and made a whole snowman on the street!
